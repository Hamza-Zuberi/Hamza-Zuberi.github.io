### Project Summary
Developed a sophisticated Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables natural language querying of over 50,000 hadith texts. The project leverages modern NLP technologies including LangChain, Sentence Transformers, ChromaDB, and Transformers to create an intelligent search and response system.

Key Features:
- Implemented a comprehensive pipeline for processing and retrieving Islamic texts
- Utilized text embedding and vector search for efficient document retrieval
- Integrated cross-encoder reranking for improved result relevance
- Generated responses with source citations for transparency
- Evaluated system performance using RAGAs metrics and retrieval metrics

Technical Stack:
- Python
- LangChain
- Sentence Transformers
- ChromaDB
- Transformers
- RAGAs

The system demonstrates the practical application of modern NLP techniques in the domain of religious texts, making Islamic knowledge more accessible through natural language interfaces.
