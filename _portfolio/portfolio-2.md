### Project Summary
Developed an advanced image-processing pipeline for generating endplate masks from lumbar spine MRI scans. The project focused on automating the segmentation of vertebral endplates to enable efficient analysis of spinal degeneration.

Key Features:
- Implemented contour detection and morphological transformations using OpenCV
- Developed metrics for comparing model-generated masks with manual annotations
- Created an efficient pipeline for vertebral region feature extraction
- Utilized IoU and nearest-neighbor metrics for performance evaluation
- Processed and analyzed DICOM medical imaging data

Technical Stack:
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- DICOM/MRI Processing

The system demonstrates the application of computer vision techniques in medical imaging analysis, providing a foundation for automated spinal degeneration assessment.
