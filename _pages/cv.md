* M.S. in Machine Learning, Milwaukee School of Engineering, Dec 2025 (expected)
* B.S. in Computer Science, Milwaukee School of Engineering

Work experience
======
* June 2024 – December 2024: ML Data Associate
  * WM Civic Alliance, Milwaukee, WI
  * Developed a data pipeline to extract and categorize information for over 500 Wisconsin state candidates
  * Conducted voter data analysis to generate regional voter profiles and improved outreach success rate by 14%
  * Applied clustering techniques (BIRCH) to segment voter regions based on demographics and past voting trends

* May 2023 – August 2023: AI Research Assistant
  * Medical College of Wisconsin, Waukesha, WI
  * Developed a pipeline for generating endplate masks and extracting pixel intensities from 312 lumbar spine MRIs
  * Used deep learning (U-Net) to automate segmentation and improve vertebral degeneration detection
  * Found correlations between Pfirrmann scores and contrast agent transfer rates in endplate regions

* May 2022 – August 2022: Software Engineering Intern
  * Milwaukee Tool, Milwaukee, WI
  * Developed ML models (logistic regression, SVM) to detect kickback in motorized ratchets
  * Improved kickback reaction time by and average of 58.7% compared to manual tuned detection
  * Converted ML models into C and successfully deployed them on embedded systems

Projects
======
* RAG for Islamic Texts -- Python, LangChain, Sentence Transformers, ChromaDB, Transformers, RAGAs 2025
  * Developed a Retrieval Augmented Generation system enabling natural language querying of over 50,000 hadith
  * Implemented a pipeline using text embedding, vector search, cross-encoder reranking, and LLM answer synthesis
  * Generated responses with source citations and evaluated variations using RAGAs metrics and retrieval metrics

* Sentiment Analysis by Fine-tuning using LoRA -- Python, Hugging Face, Transformers, LoRA 2024
  * Fine-tuned distilbert-base-uncased using LoRA to classify text as positive or negative
  * Replaced the base model head with a classification head using transfer learning
  * Achieved a 290% improvement in classification accuracy after fine-tuning

* Python/JS Data Visualization Tool -- Python, Flask, Svelte, JavaScript, Chart.js, REST API 2024
  * Developed a web component integrating a Python/Flask backend for data processing with a Svelte/JS frontend
